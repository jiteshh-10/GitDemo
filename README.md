## Repository Contents

This repository is organized by topic, with each section containing the solutions for the respective hands-on exercises.

### Week 8: Git & GitHub Hands-on

This section includes the mandatory hands-on exercises focused on learning and applying version control with Git and GitHub. The exercises cover the entire fundamental workflow of a developer.

The key skills demonstrated in this section include:
- **Repository Initialization:** Setting up a local repository using `git init`.
- **Core Git Workflow:** Staging files (`git add`), committing changes (`git commit`), and synchronizing with a remote repository (`git pull`, `git push`).
- **File Management:** Using `.gitignore` to exclude non-essential files from version control.
- **Branching & Merging:** Creating feature branches to work in isolation (`git branch`, `git checkout`) and integrating them back into the main branch (`git merge`).
- **Conflict Resolution:** Identifying and resolving merge conflicts that occur during development.
